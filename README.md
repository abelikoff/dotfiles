Installation
------------

To preview changes:

    <PATH_TO_DOTFILES>/setup.ksh

To enact changes (old files will be preserved):

    <PATH_TO_DOTFILES>/setup.ksh -f

To switch theme (only works for some terminals, Vim, and Emacs):

    <PATH_TO_DOTFILES>/set_theme.sh  <theme>

For now only two themes are supported: `Solarized` and `Monokai`.
